Fall 2020 - Computational Medicine course project - Phenotype Discovery on COVID-19 Data (HW1)

### Summary

This project uses machine learning to characterize clinical phenotypes on a sample dataset. It explores how multiple clustering algorithms (k-means, hierarchical clustering) and standard statistical tests (pairwise t-test, Fisher's exact test) can be used to determine statistically relevant features. Additionally, PCA was used to visualize the data.

Analysis was performed using Jupyter Notebook and Python.
